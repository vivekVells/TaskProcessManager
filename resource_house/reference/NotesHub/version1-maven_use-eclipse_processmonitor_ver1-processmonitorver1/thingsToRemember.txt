/**
 Notes:
   HashMap 
     helps to store & retrieve different data types
     retrieveValueBy("<key>") helps to retrieve any value of the desired key which is very easier
     easy to retrive desired entry and store in the db
     since unsynchronized, delay intentionally used to avoid the race conditions 
   BigDecimal
     used for handling precise values; seems double or float have some issues when used for handling precise values
   combined time is the Sum of User + Sys + Nice + Wait time
 Program Output:
  CPU info on machine: [2394, Intel, 4, 16, Core(TM) i5-4210U CPU @ 1.70GHz, 4]
  Total CPU usage: [92, 0, 2, 8, 0, 0, 6]
  individual cpu usage info: [{idle time=94, wait time=0, user time=0, combined=6, irq time=0, nice time=0, sys time=6}, {idle time=100, wait time=0, user time=0, combined=0, irq time=0, nice time=0, sys time=0}, {idle time=97, wait time=0, user time=3, combined=3, irq time=0, nice time=0, sys time=0}, {idle time=100, wait time=0, user time=0, combined=0, irq time=0, nice time=0, sys time=0}]
